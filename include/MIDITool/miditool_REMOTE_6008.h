    Credits: - Github user craigsapp for his "midifile" library that is used
                here to read and parse Midi files.
             - Github user waddlesplash (and contributors) for his "QMidi" library
                that is used here for playing Midi sounds (as well as for making it
                easy to use with Qt).

    Class purpose: This "MidiTool" class is a facade for the afformentioned libraries
                    that merges the two into one easy to use Midi parser and Midi player.
                    it contains an assortment of methods to pull from each note event in a midi
                    file, as well as tempo and other file specific settings.
